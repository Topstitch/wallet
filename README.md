## Description

This app is an extremely simple way to track financial transactions.  It is rather sad in comparison to a spreadsheet, so I like to think of it as a fancy automated version of the old-fashioned checkbook register.  The user enters a note about the transaction type, and then enters the amount in the appropriate column based on whether it is a debit or a credit.  The application tracks the total number of transactions and displays the current balance.  If the balance is negative, the user is warned with an alert.
